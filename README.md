# Recommender_System:

A recommender system, also known as a recommendation engine, is a type of information filtering system that predicts or suggests items that a user may be interested in.
Recommendation systems are widely used in various industries, such as e-commerce, streaming services, and social media, to provide personalized recommendations to users.

For example, in e-commerce, recommendation systems can help to increase sales by suggesting products that are likely to be of interest to a particular customer. In streaming services, recommendation systems can help to keep users engaged by suggesting content that is relevant to their interests.

Recommender systems utilize data to predict user preferences or interests. This data is commonly collected from user behavior, ratings, and content attributes. Subsequently, the system analyzes this data to forecast potential user preferences about what a user may like in the future.


There are several types of recommender systems, each employing different techniques and algorithms to generate recommendations:


1) Content-Based Filtering: Recommendation system part I: Product popularity-based system targeted at new customers

This system recommends popular products based on their attributes or characteristics, without considering user-specific data or preferences. It relies solely on the content (attributes) of the products to make recommendations, making it a content-based filtering approach.


2) Collaborative Filtering: Recommendation system part II: Model-based collaborative filtering system based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought similar items

This system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques by analyzing the purchase history and ratings of users who bought similar items. It identifies patterns and similarities among users to make recommendations based on the behavior and preferences of similar users.

3) Hybrid Recommender Systems:  Recommendation system part III: Setting up an e-commerce website for the first time without any product ratings

Since there is no existing user data or ratings available, a hybrid recommender system might be employed. It could combine different recommendation techniques, such as content-based filtering (using product attributes) and possibly other methods like rule-based recommendations or knowledge-based recommendations, to provide initial recommendations until sufficient user data is collected for more personalized recommendations.
